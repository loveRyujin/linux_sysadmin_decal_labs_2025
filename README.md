# linux_sysadmin_decal_labs 2025 Lab Solutions

This repository contains my lab solutions for the **linux_sysadmin_decal** course in Spring 2025. Each lab directory mirrors the structure provided by the course staff and includes the scripts, configuration files, and written answers required for submission.

## Repository Layout
- `lab1/`
  - `answers.md`: Written responses to the lab questions.
  - `b01/`: Supporting files and scripts for the lab tasks.

New labs will follow the same pattern: a folder per lab with subdirectories for exercises and a companion `answers.md` (or similar) documenting explanations.

## Usage
1. Navigate into the lab directory you are interested in, e.g. `cd lab1`.
2. Review the included scripts or notes to understand the approach taken for each exercise.
3. Run any shell scripts from within their lab directory to replicate the solution steps. Where necessary, scripts include comments describing expected inputs or preconditions.

## Notes
- These solutions reflect my understanding of the material; they may evolve as the course progresses.
- Feel free to compare with your own work, but always adhere to the course's academic honesty policies.

Happy sysadmin-ing!
